In nearly all of my games, clicking on the game's logo will reveal some sort of easter egg.</p>

<p align="center">
Here's a list of all of them! I intentionally kept all descriptions very cryptic but, of course, there are spoilers ahead; if you'd like to find out what they are on your own, I'd suggest <a class="brighter" href="../index">leaving this page</a>  now!</p>

<p align="center">
Also, these are in more-or-less-but-not-quite-chronological order.</p>

<p align="center">
<h1>: Bossing Around</h1>
A vision of a character from games past...
<h1>: Volcano Escape</h1>
Not on the logo, but on another thing in the main menu. You'll have to be quick to see this one.
<h1>: One Bullet</h1>
An idea that never really panned out. A memento which transcends the virtual realm into the physical.
<h1>: Missing Texture</h1>
A new phrase, a new quote to define the game.
<h1>: Uncontrollable Fall</h1>
An admission of truth.
<h1>: Bossing Around DX (Demo)</h1>
Two references in one!
<h1>: Help your Friend</h1>
An amazing new auditory experience that... doesn't actually work past the first screen. Whoops.
<h1>: Hand Washing Simulator 2020</h1>
The actual game.
<h1>: Slash Chord: The Arrival</h1>
The actual april fools joke.
<h1>: YARG</h1>
Yet Another DB
<h1>: 31 Days, 31 Games</h1>
The thirty-second, behind a code hidden in plain sight.
<h1>: someonesPC</h1>
This game doesn't have a logo to click, but before you log in, you might want to consider what it'd be like as a username...
<h1>: The Massively Important Treasure Hunt</h1>
Maybe this is it, maybe it isn't, shame you can't see.
<h1>: tawa</h1>
