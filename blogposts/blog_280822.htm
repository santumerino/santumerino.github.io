<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>Well, hello everyone! This is my blog! I'll post things here when I feel like 
talking about something, but want more than 280 characters to do it.</p>
<p>I don't really have anything to say right now, so I guess I'll start by 
adressing the elephant in the room; this website's pretty... let's call it 
&quot;quaint&quot;. Pure* HTML pages aren't exactly in vouge right now.</p>
<p>But that's on purpose. Firstly, I just like this aesthetic lol. Second, 
flashy animations and transitions are cool and all, but I like how this thing 
loads pretty much instantly, and works on pretty much anything.</p>
<p>...that said, I'd like to play around with styles that aren't so... plain. 
We'll see what happens. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*I intend on adding <a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/">Nutshell</a> by 
Nicky Case to the site. I haven't done it yet, and I have no idea how hard it'll 
be, but that's <a href="#FutureMe">:a problem for future me</a> <font color="#C0C0C0">(famous last words)</font>.</p>
<h2>:x FutureMe</h2>

<p>Note from Future-now-Present me: It wasn't that hard. Only took me, like, 5 
minutes.</p>

<p>Crazy how things can be done quickly if you actually get around to doing 
them, huh?</p>
