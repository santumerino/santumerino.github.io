Hello! This is the big YARG postmortem! It's a very ramble-y blog post where I just dump all of my thoughts, past and future, into a big mass of text. Feel free to skim it and skip to the bits you think you'll find more interesting.

But first, some history.

# SOME HISTORY
## The beginning

I first came up with the idea of YARG [back in 2019.](https://twitter.com/santumerino/status/1151867300519264257) 
Ever since I started making games, I had an idea for a platformer where... something happens. I don’t want to tell because I still want to make it one day, and the idea is both deceptively simple and not something I’ve ever seen.

Anyway, I didn’t want to jump straight into my first big game idea. That’s like, Game Development 101! Instead, I thought “hey, I’ll make a simple platformer! How hard could _that_ be?”

## The very sudden ending

...very hard, if you have no experience and the idea isn’t good.

The original idea was to make a short, 15-level game where a narrator character would constantly berate you for being so bad at the game. If it sounds familiar, that’s because it’s an extremely generic premise.

Of course, I knew that. Which is why I had a great idea in mind!

...the great idea was to call the game “Tuberbait”.

(just a mockup, the game never got to the "make a logo for it" phase of development)

It shouldn’t be surprising that I dropped the whole game not too long after. Especially when 2020 happened and sent me into a Big Sad Moment(tm).

## What now?

I abandoned the game, which by that point was already called “Yet Another Rage Game” (as an attempt to be Quirky and Self-Deprecating Lol Xd), which left me with nothing to do.

So I decided I’d give it another shot. With the idea of “make a platformer” in mind, I started working on a game called Cube Run! And to try and keep myself motivated to see it through to the end, [I even made occasional devlogs!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvotjS6-aeGHOXWCjuisWEt7Y_P6ablt7) _(WARNING: 17 year old kid with a strong accent and a bad microphone!)_

Cube Run was a story-driven platformer where you had to pick up all the coins in a level in a specific amount of time to progress. It was actually a revival of an older game project with the same name, but everything about it was brand-new.

Problem is, my implementation of the idea was just... not fun! In retrospect I can see the problems with it so clearly. It’s a game where you have to race against the clock, but you move super slowly. You have a story, but it’s told to you through walls of text. And so many more things that, if I listed them all here, this blog post would never end.

So to make a long story short, in October of that same year I dropped the project.

## The beginning (again)

After Cube Run, I started on another project (an expanded version of a game jam game, which I may revisit someday), but I wasn’t really making any progress with it, so it was also put on the shelf.

Honestly, I can’t tell you exactly why I picked YARG back up again. I think I was severely doubting my ability to finish a long-term project, and whether this whole thing was even for me in the first place. I opened the YARG project file for some reason, played it, and... it was actually fun?

I couldn’t believe it. With Cube Run, I started with a good (I think) idea and expected it to magically become a good game. With the jam game revival, I never got far enough to actually explore any interesting new concepts. But this? The story was bad, but the gameplay was fun somehow!

That was very promising, but I had to make sure I would actually see this project through to the end. So, at the beginning, I implemented a few rules for myself:

1. ~~I wouldn’t add any more gameplay elements than what was already there (spikes and lasers).~~ _I ended up adding drones and sawblades and the whole ending thing. Whoops._
1. I’d rewrite the story from scratch, ~~but it would only be alluded to through voice lines.~~ _I ended up adding the diskettes, as well as animated* cutscenes. Double whoops._
1. I’d set a deadline for myself. Sometime in mid-late 2022, actual release date TBD. _This one I actually kept!_

Now that I had these totally unbreakable rules in place, it was time to actually make the dang game! How hard could _that_ be?

# ACTUALLY MAKING THE DANG GAME
## The story

First things first, the original story had to go. I thought it would be fun to, instead of playing the whole "evil AI" trope straight, to play around with it.

## The name

I kept the name "Yet Another Rage Game" and I regret it to this day.
