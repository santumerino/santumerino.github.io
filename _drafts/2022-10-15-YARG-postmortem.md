GETTING STARTED
## The beginning
I first came up with the idea of YARG back in 2019 Santum on Twitter: "videog ame https://t.co/qGNovRHQzz" / Twitter. Ever since I started making games, I had an idea for a platformer where... something happens. I don’t want to tell because I still want to make it one day, and the idea is both deceptively simple and not something I’ve ever seen.
Anyway, I didn’t want to jump straight into my first big game idea. That’s like, Game Development 101! Instead, I thought “hey, I’ll make a simple platformer! How hard could that be?”
