i can tell you that, as the developer, i couldn't possibly care less about your data. i don't want it, don't give it to me.
</p>
<p>
however, this game implements chartboost ads. you can see their privacy policy <a href="https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/articles/200780269" style="color: #686f99;">by clicking this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
the game only connects to chartboost's servers when you click on the respawn button (which is also labelled "[AD]"). by tapping on the button and choosing to see an ad, you agree with chartboost's privacy policy. please refer to it for information on how your data is handled by them.

<p>
<i><b>tl;dr:</b> the game itself never touches any of your data, but choosing to watch an ad means you agree to the ad company's privacy policy.</u>
