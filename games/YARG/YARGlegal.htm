<h1 id="yarg-licensing-yargcensing-">YARG Licensing (Yargcensing?)</h1>
<p>I am not really too well-versed in legal stuff. All I know is that, at the end of the day, I own the copyright to
<a href="YARG.htm">YARG</a>.</p>
<p>However, I obviously want people to be inspired by my work, or to take it and improve it, or whatever. That&#39;s why I left all of the game&#39;s files out in the open.</p>
<p>I just don&#39;t know how to go about it in a &quot;proper&quot; way.</p>
<p>So these are guidelines for the things I will (and will <em>not</em>) allow involving other people using the YARG name and... &#39;brand&#39;...</p>
<p>Hopefully all of this is OK.</p>
<h2 id="merch">Merch</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>If you&#39;re an <b>individual</b> (and <i>not</i> a business or a company 
or representing one), <b>you can sell YARG merch</b> (shirts, stickers, zines?, whatever) 
as long as you <b>1. make it clear that it isn't official </b> and <b>2. 
don't do it through an online store that mass-produces them </b>(all of the 
Redbubbles of the world...) and <b>3. it isn't machine-made</b>.</li>
<li>I reserve the right to stop the sale of any unofficial item (I don't intend 
on exercising this right, unless you do something truly awful).</li>
<li>If I ever release official merch, please don't bootleg it. This isn't a &quot;rule&quot; 
rule but it might fall under Rule II if it's particularly bad.</li>
<li><b>No NFTs</b> or other such crypto nonsense, please.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mods">Mods</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>If your mod is <i>free</i>, you can publish it anywhere <b>except Steam</b>.</li>
<li>If your mod is <i>paid</i> or accepts donations, you can publish it anywhere 
you can a free mod, <b>as well as Steam if you 
shoot me an e-mail and I give you the OK</b>.</li>
<li>You must make it clear that <b>your mod is unofficial.</b> Don't call it &quot;YARG 2&quot; 
or whatever.</li>
<li><b>Only distribute your mod files!!!</b> Don't distribute the YARG exe, or 
the music, or anything you didn't make.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>Don't resell the music from the game.</ol>
<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>
<ol type="I">
<li>Fan-games fall under all of the same rules as mods, with the exception that
<b>they cannot be sold</b>.<li>Any of this is subject to change at any point 
without prior warning.<li>Obviously, gameplay videos and livestreams are OK.<li>
If you thought of something that isn't here and want to know if it's alright, 
shoot me an email at <b>santumdev (at) gmail (dot) com</b>. Chances are, if 
you're an individual and don't have an eeeeeeevil plan to destroy the game for 
everyone, I'll allow it.</ol>

<p><i>Final notes: I try to be permissive and allow people to be compensated for 
their hard work. But please, don't abuse any of this.</i></p>
<p><i>If I find people doing things I'm uncomfortable with, or which infringe my 
copyright in some flagrant way, I'll have to lock things up more and more.</i></p>
<p><i>That's bad for everyone. So please, don't do that.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" color="#808080">Piracy addendum: If you don't have the money 
to buy YARG, but really, <i>really</i> wanna play it... I allow you to torrent 
it from somewhere, <u>on the conditions</u> that you try to spread the word 
about it, and aren't a cybercafe or something. I'd also appreciate it if you 
bought it once you can afford to. &lt;3</font></p>
