# santumerino.github.io
Santum's website, cobbled together with blood, sweat, and ludicrous amounts of tutorials and StackOverflow. I also use [Nutshell](https://github.com/ncase/nutshell) by Nicky Case here and there, and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for my blog.

All of the code I made is CC0, and all of my graphical assets are all-rights-reserved (also worth mentioning is that Nutshell is CC0 too and Jekyll Now is MIT).
