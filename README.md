# santumerino.github.io
Santum's website, cobbled together with blood, sweat, and ludicrous amounts of tutorials and StackOverflow. I also use [Nutshell](https://github.com/ncase/nutshell) by Nicky Case here and there, and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)—with a dash of [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)— for my blog.

All the "code" (i.e. HTML and CSS files) I made for this website is licensed as CC0. Everything else, including writing and graphical assets, is all-rights-reserved. Thank you!
