Hey everyone! I'm cooking up a postmortem of sorts for [YARG](https://www.santumerino.com/games/YARG/YARG.htm "YARG") and so I thought I'd move the blog from my homemade, Nutshell and raw HTML-based system to something a bit more modern.

Introducing [Jekyll Now!](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) I googled "how to make blog github pages jekyll" and this popped up, so I'm running with it. We'll see how well it works!

In case you want to see all two of my previous blog posts: [here they are!](https://www.santumerino.com/blogOld.htm)

...I couldn't think of a good way to end this post. Uuh, see you when I publish the postmortem!
